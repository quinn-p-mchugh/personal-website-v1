My name is Quinn and I’m a mechanical engineer, software developer, designer, and aspiring manager with a passion for
organizational culture, workflow optimization, digital transformation, thoughtful design, and effective giving. Outside
of my professional life, I serve as a community coordinator of [Effective Altruism
Philadelphia](https://web.archive.org/web/20211104015301/https://www.meetup.com/eaphiladelphia/), a global community of
individuals trying to do the most good in the world through their time, talents, and donations.

Most notably, I completed a 4,230 mile bicycle tour across the United States to challenge myself, push my comfort zone,
and expand my worldview. Learn more here about the journey here —

This site serves as a great aggregator for all of my [technical
projects](https://web.archive.org/web/20211104015301/http://quinnmchugh.net/#projects),
[artwork](https://web.archive.org/web/20211104015301/http://quinnmchugh.net/#design), and other things I do. You can
also [view my resume](https://web.archive.org/web/20211104015301/http://quinnmchugh.net/resume/), my [_Impossible
List_](https://web.archive.org/web/20211104015301/http://quinnmchugh.net/my-impossible-list/), [books I’ve
read](https://web.archive.org/web/20211104015301/http://quinnmchugh.net/books-ive-read/), and the [different places I’ve
been](https://web.archive.org/web/20211104015301/http://quinnmchugh.net/where-ive-been/) in and around the United
States.

In my leisure time, I enjoy listening to though-provoking podcasts, (not) troubleshooting my 3D printer, designing logos
in Illustrator, listening to jazz funk, and watching BBC Nature documentaries.
