**Scroll down to see the most updated version of my Impossible List and see the goals I’m currently working on.**

Originally created by motivational blogger Joel Runyon, the Impossible List is an ever-changing list of things that an
individual would like to accomplish in their own life and includes all the things that they thought were “impossible” at
some point in time. I’ve always been a firm believer in goal setting in order to get the most out of life, so soon after
discovering the concept, I decided to create an Impossible List of my own. Since then, my Impossible List has served as
a key source of motivation for me, especially during times when I feel like my actions have slipped out of line with my
life’s goals.

You can learn more about what the Impossible List is and how it’s different from a bucket list through the link below:
