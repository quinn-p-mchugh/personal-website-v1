Throughout the fall 2015 semester, my team and I created a completely automated rotating claw mechanism that was able to
grab a 3D printed object from one square and place the object in another square. The claw mechanism was comprised of two
solenoids, two air cylinders, laser cut parts, a unidirectional motor, and an Arduino Uno. The video below shows the
mechanism in action.
