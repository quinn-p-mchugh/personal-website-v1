“Quinn is great to work with and was an excellent hire. Although he was a new graduate, he possessed great technical
skills and a high level of maturity. In his role, he showcased his ability to communicate with people regardless of
their backgrounds and to collaborate with other engineers to solve problems. His communication skills in general are
excellent; in particular, his writing is articulate and precise. His software engineering skills show similar traits to
his communication. During our time working together, Quinn utilized Python to write several scripts to automate
production tests. His code was clean and well-organized. As a Manufacturing Engineer, Quinn drew heavily on his
background in mechanical engineering. He created numerous 3D assemblies of current products to allow models to be
distributed to customers. He also created fixtures to aid operators in assembling products. Quinn set a high bar for
himself whenever he took on a project and needed little management though was always open to feedback and suggestions”

“There are some students that rise above what is offered by the typical engineering curriculum. Those that are driven by
an innate sense of curiosity and purpose. Quinn exemplifies that. Quinn thrived in academics and took every opportunity
to expand his experience at Rowan. While taking my Thermal-Fluid Sciences course, Quinn became interested in porting one
of my engineering-related iOS apps (Clausius) to Android. This meant, studying the existing iOS app and its
functionality, learning the Android development environment, and translating the same experience to a new space. When I
offered Quinn to consider this as a “for-credit” project, he refused to let go of his existing engineering projects. He
simply decided to pursue this as an add-on or a side project. Students who typically attempt this, quickly become
overwhelmed by the time commitment and lose motivation. Yet, Quinn steadily met every milestone during his senior year.
I am privileged to have students like Quinn and proud to have him represent Rowan Engineering.”

“Quinn demonstrated the ability to multitask, work with others within the organization and
self-direct his work to deliver solutions in a complex, ever‐changing environment. The fact that
he could do so over a short few months makes this even more impressive. Quinn is organized, thoughtful,
and intelligent which are traits that will serve him well in any endeavor he wishes to apply himself.  ”

“Quinn is a fast learner and easily adapted his skills to the needs of the water utility. Don’t be afraid to challenge
him, the results will be above board.”
