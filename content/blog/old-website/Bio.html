On a wintry day in the late 90’s, a baby, given the name Quinn McHugh, was born with blue eyes and sandy blonde hair.
Ever since then, I’ve lived in the suburbs of New Jersey all of my life and have spent my time exploring my passions,
creating art, and scouring every corner of the world wide web for new knowledge and tools to improve my daily life.
Despite living in the suburbs of New Jersey, I’ve been exposed to many different places, activities, and events around
the United States thanks to the variety of vacations and day trips that my family has taken me on. As a result of these
excursions, I’ve always had an interested in nature and the great outdoors.

During my childhood, my mom and dad introduced me to a plethora  of individual and team sports, but I found that I only
enjoyed playing a select few, including tennis, soccer, ping pong, and ultimate frisbee. After discovering the Internet
and being introduced to gaming consoles at a fairly early age, I fell in love with Runescape, Mario Kart, Halo, and a
variety of other video games that I could get my hands on. As a result, I developed a genuine appreciation for
technology  and have been technically literate for as long as I can remember.

![Homemade Nerf
Blaster](https://web.archive.org/web/20170830183229im_/https://i1.wp.com/quinnmchugh.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Homemade-Nerf-Blaster.jpg?resize=176%2C149)

One of the first homemade Nerf blasters I made. **Materials:** 1/2″ PVC pipe, 1/2″ PVC ball valve, a bike pump, sealant,
and a soda bottle.

In my elementary school years, I found out that you could take apart and modify the internals of Nerf blasters in order
to make them shoot faster and farther. Following this discovery, I went through a phase where I was captivated with the
inner workings of these plastic toys and would spend hours upon hours in front of my dad’s workbench learning how they
work, modifying them, and reading through [Nerf blaster blogs and
forums](https://web.archive.org/web/20170830183229/https://web.archive.org/web/20150902223610/http://www.nerfmodsreviews.com/)
to see what intricate modifications other people managed to accomplish. During this period, I even went so far as to
make a few of my own out of PVC pipe, PVC cement, epoxy putty, and other readily available materials.

After my obsession with Nerf blasters, a whole new obsession began in my freshman year of high school when I learned
about the existence of a computer game called Minecraft. During the time that I played Minecraft, I started a
multiplayer server called [Quinn’s
Craft](https://web.archive.org/web/20170830183229/https://web.archive.org/web/20131027002754/http://quinnscraft.enjin.com/),
ran it on my own desktop computer, and accumulated a moderately-sized population of players. Being the server’s owner
and administrator, I learned a multitude of things about computers, graphic design, YAML syntax, leadership,
communication skills, and how to manage a nonprofit business, which is what the server essentially was at the time.
After running that server for a little over 2 years, however, I decided that it was time to move on from Minecraft and
devote more of my time to other hobbies and responsibilities.

Around the same time that I created the Minecraft server, I founded a ski club at my high school and served as president
of the club for the next four years. Over those four years, I worked tirelessly building that ski club from the ground
up and, after many setbacks, I organized the first successful ski trip at my high school in January 2014 with a total of
52 student participants. After organizing another successful ski trip during my senior year, I passed on the presidency
to a trusted friend of mine and he has kept the club alive and thriving ever since.

When I first started the ski club, I also worked as a litter patroller for my town’s recycling center for two years.
Using some of the money I saved up, I bought a $500 mountain bike that I named “Entry-Level Larry” and soon fell in
love… with the bike, of course. Following this purchase, I cultivated a passion for learning about, repairing, cleaning,
and riding bikes, which further influenced me to become a mechanical engineering major in college.

In my junior year of high school, I became a snowboard instructor at a local ski area and worked as an ice cream scooper
at the local Ben & Jerry’s scoop shop. The following year, I was heavily involved with my high school’s yearbook club
and served as an art and student collage yearbook editor, where I did a lot of graphic design work and collaborated
extensively with my fellow yearbook editors.

I graduated high school in 2015 in the top 10% of my class and started my college career at Rowan University as a
mechanical engineering major that fall. Since then, I’ve been actively involved in a variety of clubs and organizations,
such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), intramural ultimate frisbee, and the Rowan Environmental Action League.
Through the classes I’ve taken that are listed on my
[resume](https://web.archive.org/web/20170830183229/http://quinnmchugh.net/index.php/resume/), I have learned quite a
bit about subjects that pertain to mechanical engineering and the skills necessary to be successful in the engineering
industry. The projects I’ve worked on as part of my coursework here at Rowan are listed 
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170830183229/http://quinnmchugh.net/index.php/projects/). Currently, I am apart of
the Bantivoglio Honors program, serve as the senator of the U.S. Green Building Council, was elected the Public
Relations Chair for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and am a resident assistant (RA) for the
Whitney Center here at Rowan University_._
