For my Computer Science and Programming course, I coded a game called Ultimate Tic Tac Toe in C++ to help sharpen my
coding skills. Essentially, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a much more complicated and strategic version of classic Tic Tac Toe
that will certainly test both you and your opponent’s mental ability.

In order to play, please download and run the .exe file below (It’s not a virus, I promise!). Instructions for how to
play the game are included within the program and the source code is pasted below.
