To conclude the spring 2017 semester, I was tasked with machining a multitool using a set of standard, 3-view drawings
of each component. The wrench was cut from a 3/16″ sheet of steel using a water jet. The brass piece, used for holding a
1/4″ screwdriver bit with a small magnet, was turned on a lathe. The handle of the multitool was machined from an
aluminum rod using a lathe and a mill.
